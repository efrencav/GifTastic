Orig. Deployment - September 22, 2018

This homework was challenging, it required that I go through previous class assignments and review what we covered the previous days and piece the different sections together to make this application work.

I've run the html through the Html5 Checker and it returned  with no errors or warnings. Also, I tried to comment as much as possible to indicate the step by step process if someone else was reading the code.
